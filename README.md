# Machine Learning at Scale

## Erin Werner

Machine learning at scale goes beyond the collect-and-analyze phase of big data by focusing on how machine learning algorithms can be rewritten and extended to scale to work on petabytes of data, both structured and unstructured, to generate sophisticated models used for real-time predictions.

The [assignments](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Machine_Learning_at_Scale/tree/main/Assignments) and [final project](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Machine_Learning_at_Scale/tree/main/Final_Project) in this repository will cover the different aspects within the Machine Learning at scale pipeline, such as 

* implementing the MapReduce paradigm for parallel computing
* utilizing different frameworks like Unix, Hadoop, and Spark
* designing algorithms for parallel distribution
