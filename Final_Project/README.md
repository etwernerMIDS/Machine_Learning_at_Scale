Flight delays create problems in scheduling for airlines and airports, leading to passenger inconvenience, and huge economic losses. As a result there is growing interest in predicting flight delays beforehand in order to optimize operations and improve customer satisfaction. So, the main focus of the Final Project is to predict departure delay/no delay for airline flights, where a delay is defined as 15-minute delay (or greater) with respect to the planned time of departure. This prediction is performed two hours ahead of departure, thereby giving airlines and airports time to regroup and passengers a heads up on a delay. 

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W261 - Machine Learning at Scale. These were completed using an AWS Databricks Instance.*
