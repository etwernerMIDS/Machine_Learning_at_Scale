* [Final Project](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Machine_Learning_at_Scale/blob/main/Final_Project/W261_F21_FINAL_PROJECT_TEAM13.html)

The main focus of Project 1 is querying the data. This is accomplished with SQL while utilizing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and BiqQuery. The queries answer business-driven questions using public datasets housed in GCP. The datasets are accessed through the web UI (BiqQuery) and command-line tools. Analysis and insights are performed in Jupyter Notebooks.

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W261 - Machine Learning at Scale. These were completed using an AWS Databricks Instance.*
