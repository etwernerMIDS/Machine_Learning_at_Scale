The questions below are designed to make sure you captured the key points from this reading and your async lectures. \n\n### Q1 Tasks:\n\n* __a) short response:__ Give an example of a dataset that would be appropriate to represent as a graph. What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average \"in-degree\" of a node mean in the context of your example? \n\n* __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*\n\n* __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach). What specific design component makes this approach hard to parallelize?\n\n* __d) short response:__ How does parallel breadth-first-search get around the problem that you identified in part `c`? At what expense?"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"e775bbc8-f83c-405f-859e-70dc52994def"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q1 Student Answers:\n> __a)__ The hyperlink structure of the web (or web graph) is one dataset that can be appropriate to represent as a graph. The nodes in the dataset represent the various webpage URLs; the edges are the connections line between the source URL and the target URL. The web graph described here is directed, as one source URL may contain target URLs that do not refer back to the original source URL. The average 'in-degree' of a node in this context would be the number of URLs that have that node as a target URL.\n\n> __b)__ Other than their scale and size, graphs are uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm because MapReduce does not provide any built-in mechanism for communicating global state across compute nodes. Put differently, one of the main challenges to \"dividing and conquering\" computations involving graphs is that the fundamental units of analysis (nodes and edges) carry information about each other so it often takes some careful planning to making sure that the appropriate information is co-located for the calculations we need to perform. This corresponds to the issue of traversing every node and its edges. Traversal is relatively simple on a single computer, but MapReduce requires traversals to be run in parallel. So this makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with.\n\n> __c)__ Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. It uses a modified BFS with weights and a priority queue to find the shortest path. Dijkstra is a greedy algorithm, so we assume that we have made the best choice possible in every step of the algorithm.\n\n> The algorithm goes as follows:\n\n> For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. \nWhen we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbours of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. \n\n> If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity, then stop. The algorithm has finished.\nOtherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and repeat.\n\n> This process is hard to parallelize because you must have a complete representation of the graph in order for the algorithm to run. The information in each node is required at each step, which makes the graph traversal difficult in the parallel MapReduce \n\n> __d)__ Parallel breadth-first search gets around the problem mentioned in part c by iteratively moving through the graph structure and calculating the shortest paths in a step-wise fashion. In order to accomplish this the algorithm maps over all nodes and emits a key-value pair for each neighbor on the node's adjacency list (the key contains the node id of the neighbor and the value is the current distance to the node plus one, or the distance). After a shuffle and sort, the reducers will receive keys corresponding to the destination node ids and distances of all paths leading to that node, and select the shortest. Additionally, the structure of the graph is passed through each iteration to be updated. The cost of the parallel breadth-first-search algorithm is that it requires a large amount of calculation that will eventually be discarded (basically all path lengths that are *not* the shortest)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"5ddf575d-c9d8-4228-bd60-9300256ec27d"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Question 2: Representing Graphs \n\nIn class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs.

For convenience in the code below we'll label the nodes `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E` instead of $n_1$, $n_2$, etc but otherwise you should be able to follow along & check our answers against those in the text.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/blob/master/images/HW5/Lin-Dyer-graph-Q1.png?raw=true\" width=50%>\n\n### Q2 Tasks:\n\n* __a) short response:__ Relatively speaking, is the graph you described in Figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer \"sparse\" or \"dense\"?

Sparsity/density will impact how favorable one type of representation might be preferred for a given application over the other (ie, the more sparse a representation, the more adjacency lists would be favored; the more dense a representation, the less this favoritism exists).\n\n> __b)__ The plotted graph is directed. In a directed graph, the adjacency matrices will have an asymmetry across the diagonal, as not all edges provide an equivalent relationship between nodes. In the adjacency matrix, all rows indicate a tail or a start of a potential edge, while the columns indicate the head or target of that edge. The cells in an adjacency matrix can have a value of 1 or 0 according to whether an undirected/directed edge exists or not between two vertices, respectively. Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. So, the adjacency matrices for undirected graphs are symmetric along the diagonal. This is because each node-node relationship will have the same relation representation in the matrix. In comparison, directed graphs have edges with direction. The edges indicate a one-way relationship, in that each edge can only be traversed in a single direction. Thus, the matrix representation is not necessarily symmetric."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"6fc2815b-9e04-4a6b-9957-87c0eb28a6ea"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# part a -

Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks\n\nAs you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. \n\n### Q3 Tasks:\n\n* __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?\n\n* __b) short response:__ What is the \"Markov Property\" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?\n\n* __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?\n\n* __d) code + short response:__ What is a \"right stochastic matrix\"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]\n\n* __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a \"nice\" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? \n    * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be \"nice\" in the next question_.\n    * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"2ce119d6-90ca-4141-9650-80e822f08219"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q3 Student Answers:\n> __a)__ In the context of a hypotheical infinite random walk, the PageRank metric represents the frequency that the (tireless) web surfer would encouter a particular Web Page, ie. it is the probability distribution that a particular Web Page would be arrived at by the surfer given a random walk (Lin & Dyer, 5.3).\n\n> __b)__ The Markov Property of a random process (a Markov process) states that for any given time, the conditional distribution of future states of the process depend only on the present state and not the past states (memoryless). In the context of PageRank, this means that the probability of a user going from one webpage (state) to the next is dependent on the `transition probability`.\n\n> __c)__ In the context of PageRank, $n$ states represents the number of possible web pages that the random surfer could be on at a given time. Since the transition probability matrix has dimensions of $n$ by $n$, the size will increase according to $n$^2.\n\n> __d)__ A \"right stochastic matrix\" is the transition matrix, a square matrix of nonnegative real numbers with each row summing to 1. One eigenvector of the transition matrix has an eigenvalue of 1 and is all positive. Compared to the toy adjacency matrix of paths connecting nodes/webpages, the transition matrix represents the probabily of taking a given path from a given single webpage/node.\n\n> __e)__ The process converges in five iterations.

connections."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"623cad88-8151-446e-9e72-ca4fae7964b8"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# part d

With each iteration, the probabilities decrease in value and do not add up to 1 as expected. Also, the values do not converge and reach a steady state. This is most likely due to the “sink” Node E and the lack of “teleportation” in our current algorithm. Put differently, the transition matrix is no longer right stochastic matrix as the row 'E' does not sum to 1. This is because node 'E' is a dangling node, hence there are no outgoing probabilty mass in our current approach to the 'not nice' graph. If it is not a stochastic matrix, markov chains and transitions cannot be applied.\n\n> __b)__ We can see that the E node does not connect back to any of the other nodes--it is a dangling node. This node causes problems because it is a sink node, meaning that there are no outgoing connections - only incoming. This means that the algorithm will get stuck at this node once it reaches it. So, sink nodes absorb the random surfer and set the PageRank of other pages to 0. To avoid this, we can modify the transition matrix after each iteration by adding virtual edges directed from sink nodes to all the other nodes. With this setting, the random surfer trapped in the sink nodes can jump to the other pages randomly.\n\n> __c)__ An irreducible graph is one that has a state space is a single communicating class--i.e it is possible to get to any state from any state. The webgraph is not naturally irreducible. Web URLs that do not reference any other URLs (aka, dangling nodes) render it irreducible.\n\n> __d)__ An aperiodic graph is one that has a greated common divisor of all cycle lengths equal to 1. The webgraph is not naturally aperiodic, it is possible that a webgraph has nodes that do not connect to other nodes or that the web graph has nodes that are self-referrential, violating aperiodicity.\n\n> __e)__  To solve irreducibility and aperiodicity, the PageRank algorithm is given the ability to 'teleport' to any other nodes with a non-zero percentage. This can be done by replacing an all zero-probability row with probabilities of $1/n$. This ensures that the given row is right stochastic and maintains the irreducibility of the webgraph. Intuitively, this adjustment means that for pages that don't want to link out, the modified model automatically creates invisible links so that the algorithm never gets stuck; when the ‘random surfer’ enters a dangling node, he can hyperlink to any page at random. We can also implement teleportation in order to guarantee aperiodicity. So, a proportion of the time the random surfer will be following links at random and a proportion of the time he will be 'teleporting' to a new URL. The teleporting is random because the teleportation matrix is uniform, which means that the random surfer is equally likely to jump to any page when he teleports. These modifications will ensure both aperiodicity and irreducibility."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"ca551e99-dca0-4218-95c8-0cfb05052d14"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#

EDA part 2 (out-degree distribution)\n\nAs you've seen in previous homeworks the computational complexity of an implementation depends not only on the number of records in the original dataset but also on the number of records we create and shuffle in our intermediate representation of the data. The number of intermediate records required to update PageRank is related to the number of edges in the graph. In this question you'll compute the average number of hyperlinks on each page in this data and visualize a distribution for these counts (the out-degree of the nodes). \n\n### Q6 Tasks:\n* __a) code:__ In the space provided below write a Spark job to stream over the data and compute all of the following information:\n * count the out-degree of each non-dangling node and return the names of the top 10 pages with the most hyperlinks\n * find the average out-degree for all non-dangling nodes in the graph\n * take a 1000 point sample of these out-degree counts and plot a histogram of the result. \n \n \n* __b) short response:__ In the context of the PageRank algorithm, how is information about a node's out degree used?\n\n* __c) short response:__ What does it mean if a node's out-degree is 0? In PageRank how will we handle these nodes differently than others?\n \n__`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1086ad2d-8dd1-447e-b41f-3d0f75dd5bd9"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q6 Student Answers:\n\n> __b)__ There are three distinct factors that determine the PageRank of a node: the number of links it receives, the link propensity of the linkers, and the centrality of the linkers. The PageRank is calculated by the number and value of incoming links to a website. Yet, the information about a node’s out-degree is also important with regard to centrality. Reasonably, the value of the endorsement depreciates proportionally to the number of links given out by the endorsing node. So, the PageRank centrality $x{i}$ of node $i$ is given by: $$x_i = \\alpha \\sum_k \\frac{a\\{k,i}}{d_k} \\, x_k + \\beta$$ where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants and $d_k$ is the out-degree of node $k$ if such degree is positive, or $d_k = 1$ if the out-degree of $k$ is null. \n\n> __c)__ A node is considered to be a “sink” if its out-degree is 0. This means that there are only incoming links to the node with no other links to follow and “flow” out of. PageRank handles these nodes differently than others by implementing teleportation and setting a default out-node value to 1 when calculating the centrality."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"97f4190c-129b-4bd0-bfca-b146672087ef"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# part a

Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)\n\nOne of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. \n\n__`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\\\(N\\\\).\n\n### Q7 Tasks:\n* __a) short response:__ What is \\\\(N\\\\)? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to \\\\(\\frac{1}{N}\\\\). (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)\n\n* __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute \\\\(N\\\\) before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.\n\n* __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that:\n  * parses each input record\n  * creates a new record for any dangling nodes and sets it list of neighbors to be an empty set\n  * initializes a rank of 1/N for each node\n  * returns a pair RDD with records in the format specified by the docstring\n\n\n* __d) code:__ Run the provided code to confirm that your job in `part a` has a record for each node and that your should records match the format specified in the docstring and the count should match what you computed in question 5. [__`TIP:`__ _you might want to take a moment to write out what the expected output should be fore the test graph, this will help you know your code works as expected_]\n \n__`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"6f3a83cb-5b19-4818-8eeb-86ed4d0c9a14"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q7 Student Answers:\n\n> __a)__ N is the total number of nodes in the graph, including the dangling nodes. We initialize each node to 1/N representing equal probability of going from any node to any other node. Using the analogy of the surfer, this means that the probability of a random websurfer arriving at each webpage is the same.\n\n> __b)__ Computing N only after initializing all nodes RDD is more efficient. To find N we need to run spark job that counts the nodes and the edges to incldue dangling nodes. If we use countNodes function from the previous question to get N, we need to repeat the spark job to build the all nodes RDD, which involves two map-reduce jobs. By builidng all nodes that includes dangling nodes first and then counting the final RDD, we can optimize this into a single pass."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f383a220-a74c-4cf4-b833-b1aa2319bba9"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# part c - job to initialize the graph (RUN THIS CELL AS IS)\ndef initGraph(dataRDD):\n    \"\"\"\n    Spark job to read in the raw data and initialize an \n    adjacency list representation with a record for each\n    node (including dangling nodes).\n    \n    Returns: \n        graphRDD -  a pair RDD of (node_id , (score, edges))\n        \n    NOTE: The score should be a float, but you may want to be \n    strategic about how format the edges... there are a few \n    options that can work.

rank. In this last question you'll write a Spark job that iterates over the initialized graph updating each nodes score until it reaches a convergence threshold. The diagram below gives a visual overview of the process using a 5 node toy graph. Pay particular attention to what happens to the dangling mass at each iteration.\n\n<img src='https://github.com/kyleiwaniec/w261_assets/blob/master/images/HW5/PR-illustrated.png?raw=true' width=50%>\n\n\n\n__`A Note about Notation:`__ The formula above describes how to compute the updated page rank for a node in the graph. The $P$ on the left hand side of the equation is the new score, and the $P$ on the right hand side of the equation represents the accumulated mass that was re-distributed from all of that node's in-links. Finally, $|G|$ is the number of nodes in the graph (which we've elsewhere refered to as $N$).\n\n### Q8 Tasks:\n* __a) short response:__ In terms of the infinite random walk analogy, interpret the meaning of the first term in the PageRank calculation: $\\alpha * \\frac{1}{|G|}$\n\n* __b) short response:__ In the equation for the PageRank calculation above what does $m$ represent and why do we divide it by $|G|$?\n\n* __c) short response:__ Keeping track of the total probability mass after each update is a good way to confirm that your algorithm is on track. How much should the total mass be after each iteration?\n\n* __d) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that take the initialized graph as its input then iterates over the graph and for each pass:\n  * reads in each record and redistributes the node's current score to each of its neighbors\n  * uses an accumulator to add up the dangling node mass and redistribute it among all the nodes. (_Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration!_)\n  * uses an accumulator to keep track of the total mass being redistributed.( _This is just for your own check, its not part of the PageRank calculation. Don't forget to reset this accumulator after each iteration._)\n  * aggregates these partial scores for each node\n  * applies telportation and damping factors as described in the formula above.\n  * combine all of the above to compute the PageRank as described by the formula above.\n  * \n  \n   __WARNING:__ Some pages contain multiple hyperlinks to the same destination, please take this into account when redistributing the mass.\n\n \n__`NOTE:`__ Please observe scalability best practices in the design of your code & comment your work clearly. You will be graded on both the clarity and the design."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"0dcf0700-6867-4354-8fe3-6d9e8d209ae9"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q8 Student Answers:\n\n> __a)__ $\\alpha$ is the probability where a random walker can teleport to any other page in the webgraph.
