    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning. This is similar to the intuition behind the word2vec algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ when it makes sense to take a stripe approach and when to use pairs\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",

    "Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads that utilizes in-memory caching and optimized query execution for fast queries against data of any size. Spark is closely related to MapReduce in functionality, with the primary difference being that Spark processes and retains data in memory for subsequent steps, whereas MapReduce processes data on disk. As a result, for smaller workloads, Spark's data processing speeds are much faster than MapReduce.\n",

This is because Spark Streaming uses the concept of DStreams, which are basically micro batches of data that are RDDs. DStream transformations can be both stateless, which follows the principles of functional programming, and stateful, which deviates from those same principles. While some of Spark's RDD operators are stateless, such as map or filter, the programmer can also implement stateful features as they may also ask Spark to persist an RDD in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently across parallel operations.\n",

It is useful to pay attention to the DAGs as they are, essentially, an execution plan that allows transformations to be evaluated lazily when triggered by an action and more complex DAGs may need to reuse the contents of an RDD for multiple downstream operations. This information is especially useful when checking the results of our Spark streaming jobs.\n"

    "With cosine similarity, we’re considering vectors in spaces. The cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, and gets larger when the angle in question is smaller. In the numerator, the dot product of two vectors describes the extent that the vectors point in the same direction. It is defined as: $\\sum{a_i * b_i}$. A dot product is a scalar, and can be positive or negative. If the dot product is zero, vectors are perpendicular (properly: they are orthogonal) and don’t point in any of the same directions. If positive, they point in the same direction. If negative, they point in opposite directions. Thus, the numerator of cosine similarity is a bare dot product. In the denominator, the norm of a vector describes its length or magnitude: how ‘far’ it is pointing. This is computed as: $||a|| = \\sqrt{\\sum{a_i^2}}$. Norms are always positive scalar values. So, the denominator is related to the size of the sets that each vector represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of word counts in documents A and B, we need to consider both parts of the equation. The numerator can only increase when a term is present in both documents, and it goes up by the product of the two weightings. So this part of the equation can be understood as a kind of numerical intersection, where more strongly weighted words increase its value. The denominator of the cosine similarity is the product of its two vector norms. Dividing a vector by its norm rescales its components so that the length is 1. This allows us to compare each document on equal footing. \n",

    "Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. There are other similarity metrics besides cosine similarity - although they vary from it, they have some similarities to it as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, there is the Jaccard similarity, which is used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. The formula is as follows: $$\\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$$\n",
    "The Jaccard coefficient measures the similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. So, although it is similar to the cosine similarity, the Jaccard similarity takes only a unique set of words for each sentence or document while the cosine similarity takes the total length of the vectors. Thus, in Jaccard Similarity, the number of common attributes is divided by the number of attributes that exist in at least one of the two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, there is the overlap coefficient, which is a similarity measure that measures the overlap between two finite sets. It is similar to the Jaccard similarity and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the smaller of the size of the two sets, as follows: $$\\frac{|A \\cap B|}{min(|A|, |B|)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is similar to the cosine similarity, but the denominator represents the smaller size of the two sets. Thus, it represents the percentage of overlap as it relates only to the smallest volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, there is also the Dice metric, which is represented by the following formula: $$\\frac{2 |A \\cap B|}{|A| + |B|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dice Coefficient can be seen as the percentage of overlap between the two sets, that is a number between 0 and 1. It is similar to the cosine similarity, but it is different as it only counts true positives once in both the numerator and denominator. It can be viewed as a similarity measure over sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these metrics would lead to different similarity rankings for sets of documents with longer lengths. This is because cosine considers the total document length, whereas these other metrics consider the unique terms within the document. As a result, Jaccard index can be useful in some domains like semantic segmentation, text mining, E-Commerce, and recommendation systems and Dice is used in lexicography, image segmentation, and other applications.\n",

However, these words are very common (i.e. “the”, “of”, and “a”). Although there are more meaningful similar words for docA and docC as well as docB and docC, there are less shared instances.

    "# Question 3: Synonym Detection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the idea of co-occurrance comes in. Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

    "# Question 4: Pairs and Stripes at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read in the paper by Zadeh et al, the advantage of metrics like Cosine, Dice, Overlap and Jaccard is that they are dimension independent -- that is to say, if we implement them in a smart way the computational complexity of performing these computations is independent of the number of documents we want to compare (or in our case, the number of terms that are potential synonyms). One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we'll take a closer look at the computational complexity of the synonym detection approach we took in question 3 and then revist the document similarity example as a way to explore a more efficient approach to parallelizing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. In your own words, define each of these terms ('postings' and 'inverted index') based on your reading of the provided code. (*DITP by Lin and Dyer also contains a chapter on the Inverted Index although in the context of Hadoop rather than Spark. You may find the illustration in Chaprter 4 helpful in answering this question*).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",

    "In general, a one-hot encoding scheme results in high-dimensional, sparse datasets, which are difficult to optimize. Also, each of the information-sparse columns have a linear relationship with each other. This means that one variable can be easily predicted using the others, causing problems of parallelism and multicollinearity in high dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the optimal dataset consists of features whose information is independently valuable. Thus, the ‘stripes’ dataset is more efficient than the one-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations. A “stripe” is an associative array where the key is a term, and the array holds the key value pairs where each key is a term which co-occurs with the primary key and the values are the count. The main advantage here is that we are shuffling a lot less data over the network. And by using reduce by key, we're giving Spark an opportunity to do some parallized combining for us behind the scenes. However, we're limited in terms of the event space. So, we cannot afford to make our associative arrays larger than will fit in memory on a single machine. Overall, the stripes approach is faster and more efficient, but we have to be mindful of managing memory.\n",

    "Based on the code, a ‘posting’ is just a simple document id. So, the ‘inverted index’ is the dictionary object that contains the inverted termID–docID pairs. But, the inversion is actually accomplished by a two-step process. First, we sort the termID–docID/docLength pairs. Next, we collect all termID–docID/docLength pairs with the same termID into a postings list. This posting list/inverted index then consists of key value pairs where the key is a word and the value is the document id & document length pair. For example, the inverted index would consist of values in the following format: [WORD] = [(DOC_ID, DOC_LENGTH)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ \n",
    "\n",
    "The third mapper loops over the inverted index and produces pairs of document id values with the count of 1 for each document pair that a given word occurs in. For example, an output would have the following format: {[(document_id_1, document_len_1), (document_id_2, document_len_2)], 1}. The different pieces of information included in the composite key are the document pairs that a given word is found in, as well as each document's respective length. The composite key also includes a value of 1. This represents the count of occurrences for this given document pair which, when aggregated, represents the intersection value between the two documents. It makes sense to synchronize around this information for document similarity calculations because it stores the document pairs, their individual lengths, and their counts for the ultimate intersection value. These are all pieces of information that are necessary to perform Jaccard or Cosine similarity between two documents. Yet, in order to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity, we also need to know the actual aggregated intersection value for each document pair. This will require a reduceByKey transformation after the mapper is executed.\n",

    "In Narrow transformations, all the elements that are required to compute the records in a single partition live in the single partition of parent RDD. A limited subset of the partition is used to calculate the result. Narrow transformations are the result of functions like map() or filter(). In wide transformations, all the elements that are required to compute the records in the single partition may live in many partitions of parent RDD. The partition may live in many partitions of parent RDD. Wide transformations are the result of groupbyKey and reducebyKey functions. So, out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, the two reduceByKey transformations are wide while the one map and three flatMap transformations are narrow. "

Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",

    "The most frequent words for the N-Gram corpus are: {‘the’, ‘of’, ‘to’, ‘in’, ‘a’, ‘and’, ‘that’, ‘is’, ‘be’, & ‘as’}. In general these words are syncategorematic, meaning that they are either articles, connectives, prepositions, or quantifiers. This means that these words do not stand by themselves, but rather help form the syntax/structure of a sentence. Thus, these words do not have meaning in themselves and are not indicative of the context of a given sentence. Also, these words do not have any synonyms or antonyms.

Each word shares a count of 40 instances. In a vocabulary consisting of 269,339 unique terms, these words are considered to be uncommon. This means that they will have less representation in the overall corpus and that there is less context to understand the given word's meaning in order to parse an appropriate synonym. Consequently, they will then have less accurate similarity scores due to their infrequency. Also, the terms mostly consist of nouns, so they will not necessarily have any synonyms or antonyms. As a result, we should not expect the detected ‘synonyms’ for these words to be reliable."

    "We randomly sampled 1% of the unique neighbor data and then plotted the histogram distribution of these counts. From the standard plots, we can see that the distribution is unimodal and is heavily right skewed, with most values being under 500. There is a major peak around the lower values and a long tail. However, we can take the log transform of the data in order to get a more detailed look at the distribution. So, from the log transformed histogram, we can see that the distribution is still unimodal with a right skew, but it isn’t as extreme as before. There is also a fatter tail that goes into the higher log(unique neighbor count) values. These distributions will affect our synonym detection analysis. This is because words will generally have fewer neighbors and, thus, less context that would help to determine an appropriate synonym. \n",

    "# Question 7: Basis Vocabulary & Stripes\n",
    "\n",
    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary'. Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) multiple choice:__ Suppose we were deciding between two different basis vocabularies: the 1000 most frequent words or the 1000 least frequent words. How would this choice impact the quality of the synonyms we are able to detect? How does this choice relate to the ideas of 'overfitting' or 'underfitting' a training set?\n",

    "  \n",
    "  BONUS: Explain your answer \n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ If we had a much larger dataset, computing the full ordered list of words would be extremely expensive. If we need to none-the-less get an estimate of word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary, what alternative strategy could we take?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) multiple choice:__ Run the provided spark job that does the following:\n",
    "  * tokenizes, removes stopwords and computes a word count on the ngram data\n",
    "  * subsets the top 10,000 words (these are the terms we'll consider as potential synonyms)\n",
    "  * subsets words 9,000-9,999 (this will be our 1,000 word basis vocabulary)    \n",
    "  (to put it another way - of the top 10,000 words, the bottom 1,000 form the basis vocabulary)\n",
    "  * saves the full 10K word list and the 1K basis vocabulary to file for use in `d`.  \n",

    "The answer is A - 1000 most frequent words would overfit, while 1000 least frequent words would underfit. This is because these vocabulary words would provide different types of context for determining the synonyms. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __a-bonus)__ \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the least frequent words can have a count of 1, meaning that they are very uncommon in the corpus. As a result, they would be too specific and not be able to provide much context that would be necessary in order to produce appropriate synonyms. This means there is not enough information to determine synonyms and would lead to underfitting the data. Furthermore, in a large corpus, the most common words generally consist of frequent stop words. These are not particularly useful for synonym detection. Also, the non-stop words in the 1000 most frequent are used frequently enough that their context is general, meaning that they are not specific enough to provide valuable information for calculating a synonym. This would lead to overfitting the data. Thus, the 1000 most frequent words would overfit, while 1000 least frequent words would underfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ \n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a much larger dataset and needed to get an estimate of the word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary, we would not want to top or bottom most frequent words. Instead we would want the middle most frequent words. This is because these words will be general enough to be used somewhat frequently throughout the text, but not be so frequent that they don’t provide useful information about the context. So, an alternative strategy we could take to decide on a basis vocabulary would be to calculate the size of the dataset and then use that value to find the “middle” 100 most frequent words.\n",

    "The word stripes are able to \"represent\" a term's meaning. The feature space for this representation is a vector of representative words that considered to be neighbors to the given term. So, the features of our 1-hot encoded vectors are the words that make up the basis vocabulary. the maximum length of a stripe is 1000. This is because stripes are made up of terms from the basis vocabulary, which was a 1000 word subset from the middle of the word frequency corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be 1000 rows in our inverted index. This is because each stripe was formed from the basis vocabulary, which was made up of 1000 unique terms. So, a stripe can only potentially consist of the 1000 words in that subset. As a result, the inverted index will have a row for each of those 1000 basis vocabulary terms, with a basis term - [vocab term] structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ \n",
    "\n",
    "An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches. So, we need the inverted index in order to quickly interate through the terms and compute the cosine similarity from the postings. In general, we are able to leverage the basis term - [vocab term] structure of the inverted index to optimize our similarity calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__\n",
    "\n",
    "From our results, we can see that the quality of the \"synonym\" analysis is not very good. Even though they produce good similarity metric scores, most of the pairs are not necessarily synonyms at all. In general, the pairs seem to be made up of adjatives and nouns, such as \"great - time\". So, in order to improve the analysis, I would try to compare word pairs in the vocabulary that are not necessarily neighbors but have similar neighbors in their stripes. This would mean that the two words are used in similar contexts in the text. Thus, they would be more likely to be synonyms."
